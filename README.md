# 50Projects-50Days

"50 Projects in 50 Days" is a collection of projects that I completed as part of a guided web development course. Over the span of 50 days, I worked on various mini-projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, documenting my progress on GitHub and adding my own creative touch to each of them.

Under the guidance of an experienced instructor, I delved into different aspects of web development, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. The projects featured in this repository showcase the practical application of these technologies and highlight my learning journey.
